## Sustainability Policy Template

We are in a climate emergency, and we need to make sweeping changes in how we live and work.

One of the _many_ tools we'll need to use is policy, at an organisational level, to help make the decisions that help us reach zero emissions, and minimise the harm already being caused by our changing climate.

So, here's a template you can use as a starting point, to get an idea of where, if you work in digital/tech company the main levers might be to effect measurable change.
